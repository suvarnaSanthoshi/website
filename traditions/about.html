<div class="matter">
<p>Indian culture and traditions are something which has now become renowned all across the world. 
We all refer to customs and traditions of India as something very diverse and unique. But seldom 
do we give a thought to why things are done in certain specific ways. Indian culture is full of 
several unique customs and traditions, which outsiders might find intriguing. Most of these 
originate from the Ancient Indian scriptures and texts, which have dictated the way of life in 
India for thousands of years.</p>

<br>
<br>
<img src="s2.jpg" alt="Namaste">
<p>The Namaste is one of the most popular Indian customs and isn't just restricted to the Indian 
territory anymore. You have Barack Obama, who has been seen doing it on various occasions, or 
you had Ban Ki-Moon, the UN Secretary-General, greeting everyone with a namaste at the Times 
Square in New York on the first International Yoga Day.</p>
<br>
<br>
<span class="decorate">Festivals & Religion</span>
<br>
<br>
<img src="s3.jpg" alt="Festivals & Religion">
<p>India also sees a large number of festivals, mainly because of the 
prevalence of diverse religions and groups. The Muslims celebrate Eid, the Christians have 
Christmas and good Friday, the Sikhs have Baisakhi (harvesting of crop), and the birthdays of 
their Gurus and the Hindus have Diwali, Holi, Makar Sakranti, the Jains have Mahavir Jayanti, 
the Buddhists celebrate the Buddha's birthday on Buddha Poornima, and quite honestly, the 
number is endless. All of these translate to holidays in our book, of course.</p>
<br>
<br>
<span class="decorate">JOINT FAMILIES</span>
<br>
<br>
<img src="s12.jpg" alt="Family Structure">
<p>Also, in India, there exists the concept of a joint family, wherein the 
entire family (parents, wife, children and in some cases, relatives) all live together. This 
is mostly because of the cohesive nature of the Indian society, and also reportedly helps in 
handling pressure and stress.</p>
<br>
<br>
<span class="decorate">Symbol</span>
<br>
<br>
<img src="s10.jpg" alt="Symbol">
<p>Symbols or nature worship, system of religion based on the veneration of natural phenomena, for example, 
celestial objects such as the sun and moon and terrestrial objects such as water and fire. Stars, rain, and animals are comprehended as natural objects or forces 
that influence them and are thus in some way worthy of being venerated or placated. Nature as an 
entity in itself, in contrast with human society and culture or even with God, is a philosophical 
or poetic conception that has been developed among advanced civilizations. This concept of nature 
worship, therefore, is limited primarily to scholars involved in or influenced by the modern 
 study of religion.</p>
<br>
<br>
<span class="decorate">Architecture - The Science Behind Temples</span>
<br>
<br>
<img src="s11.jpg" alt="Architecture">
<p>Most temples are located along magnetic wave lines of the Earth, which 
help in maximising the available positive energy. The copper plate (called Garbhagriha or 
Moolasthan) buried under the main idol absorbs and resonates this energy to its surroundings. 
Going to the temple often helps in having a positive mind and garnering positive energies, 
which in turn lead to healthier functioning.It is also a practice to take off footwear before 
entering places of worship because they would bring in the dirt to an otherwise cleansed and 
sanctified environment.</p>
<br>
<br>
<span class="decorate">Traditions and Customs - Atithi Devo Bhavah</span>
<br>
<br>
<img src="s5.jpg" alt="Tradition and Customs">
<p>In India, the saying'Atithi Devo Bhavah' is also integral. It means 
'the guest is equivalent to god'. It is a Sanskrit verse taken from the Hindu scriptures, 
which later became a part of the Code of conduct for Indian society since the guest has 
always been of supreme importance in the Culture of India.</p>
<br>
<br>
<span class="decorate">Dresses of India - Indian Ethnic Wear</span>
<br>
<br>
<img src="s6.jpg" alt="Dresses of India">
<p>Indian women are often seen sporting 'saris'. The sari is a single 
cloth and needs no stitching; it is easy to make and comfortable to wear, and also adheres to
religious etiquette. It initially started as a Hindu tradition but has very elegantly spread 
across all religions. The same applies to the more functional 'Kurta-Pyjama', and the formal 
wear of 'Sherwani' for Indian men of all faiths.</p>
<br>
<br>
<span class="decorate">Dances of India</span>
<br>
<br>
<img src="s7.jpg" alt="Dances of India">
<p>India is a land of 'unity in diversity', and our dances are no different.
Different forms of dance(classified as folk or classical) find origin from different parts of 
the country, and they are a way of representation of the particular culture from which they 
originate. Eight classical dances, which are classified as Indian classical dances and find a 
mention in the Hindu Sanskrit text 'Natyashashtra' are: Bharathanatyam, Kathak, Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Manipuri, Mohiniyattam, Odiddi, Sattriya</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="decorate">Cuisine - Indian Food</span>
<br>
<br>
<img src="s8.jpg" alt="Cuisine">
<p>Indian food and cuisine not only form an integral part of the culture of
India but are also one of the critical factors of India's popularity worldwide. The style of 
cooking varies from region to region, though unanimously, Indian food has a significant 
reputation for its extensive use of spices and herbs. Just like dances, religious practices, 
language and clothes, you will also find a wide variety of food throughout the country. Almost 
every region is known for a signature dish or ingredient.</p>
<br>
<br>
<span class="decorate">Languages</span>
<br>
<br>
<img src="s9.jpg" alt="Languages">
<p>India is socially, culturally, and linguistically very diverse. Hindi 
and English are widely spoken and recognised for official purposes. Other than than, there are
22 scheduled languages recognised by the constitution of India. However, more than 400 
languages and dialects in India are still not known. Dialects change even with a few 
kilometres of travel in the state. Over the years, about 190 languages have become endangered 
due to very few surviving speakers.<br>
There exist thousands of traditions and culture in India, and quite a few of them would leave 
outsiders rather curious. But the crux of Indian society and culture has always been to be well
mannered, polite, respect others, and progress together.</p>
